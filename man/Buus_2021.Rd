\title{Obtain the Buus_2021 data}
\usage{
Buus_2021()
}
\description{
Obtain the single cell CITE-seq data from healthy donors and a lung tumor
patient from Buus et al (2021).
}
\details{
CITE-seq of PBMCs from healthy donors and lung tumour cells from a
single patient.  Different antibody staining conditions were tested.

Buus \emph{et al} aligned the RNA-seq reads using kallisto to a polyA
transcriptiome based on the CellRanger GTF.

Data was downloaded from Figshare
\url{https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5018987}

Code from the original study is available (link below).

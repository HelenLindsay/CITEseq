\description{
Obtain the blood and kidney CITE-seq data from Krebs et al. (2020).
}
\details{
CITE-seq of CD3+ T-cells from blood and kidney of renal patients, including
patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)â€“associated
glomerulonephritis (GN), a renal autoimmune disease. Samples include:
\itemize{
\item{CD3+ from 3 samples of healthy regions of kidney patients
undergoing tumor nephrectomy (5905 cells)}
\item{CD3+ from blood from patients undergoing tumor nephrectomy}
\item{CD3+ cells from renal biopsies from 6 patients with
ANCA-GN (6829 cells)}
\item{CD3+ cells from blood from 6 patients with ANCA-GN }
}
WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER THE BLOOD SAMPLES ARE FROM THE SAME PATIENT, PAPER SAYS
"for some of the analyses matched blood samples from the same patient were used"

CellRanger was used to demultiplex and align RNA and ADT reads.
TCRgd (gamma/delta) occurs in the data but not the ADT distribution Figure S2.

Data were downloaded from Figshare

Mouse scRNA-seq samples are also available but not included here.

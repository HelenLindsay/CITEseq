#' @details
#'Chung \emph{et al} introduce a new method inCITE-seq (intranuclear CITE-seq)
#'enabling the measurement of intranuclear transcription factors. This data set
#'is a HeLa cell line with (condition TNFa) and without (condition NT)
#'stimulation by TNF-alpha, with intranuclear p65 levels measured by
#'DNA-conjugated antibodies.
#'
#'Data were downloaded from

#'
#'The study also profiled a mouse brain sample in response to pharmacological
#'treatment.  The mouse samples are not included here.

#' Obtain the HeLa inCITE-seq data from Chung et al. (2021).
#'
#' @details
#'Chung \emph{et al} introduce a new method inCITE-seq (intranuclear CITE-seq)
#'enabling the measurement of intranuclear transcription factors. This data set
#'is a HeLa cell line in response to cytokine stimulation with a single
#'transcription factor (p65) profiled by DNA-conjugated antibodies.
#'
#'The study also profiled a mouse brain sample in response to pharmacological
#'treatment.  The mouse samples are not included here.

#'@details
#'
#'This is a CITE-seq data set of hemopoietic stem cell (HSC) progenitors
#'differentiated \emph{in vitro} from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC).
#'CD235a- cells were sorted at days 10 and 13 after addition of
#'differentiation medium to hPSCs. At day 13 suspension cells were further
#'sorted into CD43+ and CD43- and mixed at a ratio of 25%/75%.
#'Adherent cells at day 10 and day 13 were sorted into CD31+ and CD31- using
#'treated as separate samples.
#'
#'RNA data were aligned to GRCh38 using CellRanger.
#'
#'scRNA-seq of CD235a-CD43+ cells from 2 replicate cultures is available
#'but not included in this data set.
#'
#'A code repository is available (see below).

#'@details
#'Rincon Arevalo \emph{et al} collected peripheral blood from kidney disease
#'patients and healthy
#'controls at baseline (before vaccination) and after the second dose of
#'vaccination with the BioNTech/Pfizer Sars-CoV-2/COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.
#'
#'This data set is CITE-seq of selected cells sorted from peripheral blood
#'samples from
#'4 kidney transplant recipients after the second vaccination dose.  Of the 4
#'patients, 3 did not show a serological response to
#'vaccination and one was a responder with an infection.  Peripheral blood
#'was enriched for CD19, CD3 and CD138 cells using bead enrichment and sorted
#'using FACs into three populations:
#'\itemize{
#' \item{DAPI-CD3-CD14-CD16-CD38++CD27++ permablasts}
#' \item{DAPI-CD3-CD14-CD16-CD38varCD27+ memory B-cells}
#' \item{DAPI-CD3+CD14-CD16-CD38+HLA-DR+ activated T-cells}
#'}
#' The three populations were pooled in equal proportions for CITE-seq.
#'
#' Counts were generated using CellRanger v5.0.0.

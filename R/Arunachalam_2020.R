#' Obtain the single cell COVID-19 PBMC CITE-seq data from Arunachalam et al.
#' (2020).
#'
#' @details
#'CITE-seq of 7 COVID-19 patients and 5 age-matched healthy controls.
#'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were enriched for dendritic
#'cells using bead enrichment. Enriched cells were mixed with PBMCs at
#'a 1:2 ratio.  Cell ranger was used for demultiplexing and counting.
#'
#'The experiment was performed in two batches. No major batch effects were
#'detected via a UMAP plot in the original study.
#'
#'Bulk RNA-seq data for a larger sample pool is also available but not
#'included here.

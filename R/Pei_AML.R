#'@details
#'CITE-seq of one acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient at diagnosis and after
#'relapse (patient 12 in Supplementary Table 1).  This patient was chosen
#'because whole exome sequencing did not confirm expectations based on
#'clinical data.
#'
#'Counts were generated with Cell Ranger v3.1.
#'
#'Bulk RNA-seq and whole exome sequencing of a larger patient group is
#'available but not included in this data set.

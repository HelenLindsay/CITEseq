#'@details
#'This data set is CITE-seq of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) from a
#'single human donor.  The cell suspension was split into 10 aliquots and
#'stained with hashtag antibodies to enable detection of doublets and empty
#'drops.
#'
#'Stuart \emph{et al} introduce a method of data integration implemented in
#'the Seurat package.  The CITE-seq data was integrated with the Human Cell
#'Atlas single cell bone marrow data set.

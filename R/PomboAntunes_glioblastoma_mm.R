#' Obtain the mouse glioblastoma single cell CITE-seq data from

#'
#' @details
#'CITE-seq of CD45+ cells from GL261 tumors from wildtype and
#'Ccr2-knockout mice (tumors from three individual mice pooled per sample).
#'The antibody panel includes 6 isotype controls.
#'
#'The colData includes the cluster identity and assignment
#'from the original study.
#'
#'Information on mice is available in the Research Reporting Summary of
#'the original paper and the mouse CITE-seq antibody panel is in
#'Supplementary Table 14.
#'
#'Additional data available but not included here:
#'\itemize{
#'  \item{scRNA-seq for 7 patients with newly diagnosed and 4 patients with
#'  recurrent glioblastoma}
#'  \item{scRNA-seq for CD45+ immune cells from GL261 tumors (mouse).}

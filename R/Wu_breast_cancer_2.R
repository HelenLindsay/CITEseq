#' Obtain the CITE-seq data from a cryopreserved breast cancer sample from
#' Wu \emph{et al.} (2021).
#'
#'@details
#'Wu \emph{et al.} demonstrate that CITE-seq can be successfully applied on
#'a cyropreserved solid tumor.  For this data set, CITE-seq was performed on
#'a single human breast cancer tumor (subtype triple negative) using a panel of
#'15 cell type markers.
#'
#'Reads were demultiplexed using CellRanger and counted using CITE-seq-count
#'v.1.4.3
#'
#'A code repository is available (see below).
#'
#'Wu \emph{et al.} also performed scRNA-seq on three types of solid tumors -
#'breast, prostate and melanoma.  scRNA-seq data is available under accession
#'EGAS00001005115.

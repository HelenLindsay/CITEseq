#' Obtain the targeted CITE-seq coeliac patient data from Trzupek et al. (2020).
#'
#' @details
#' CITE-seq from paired PBMC and duodenal biopsies from two patients with
#' pediatric Coeliac disease.
#'
#' CD45+ cells were enriched from duodenal biopsy samples using gradient
#' separation.  CD45+ cells from both sample types were further isolated by
#' FACs.
#'
#' This study used the 397 gene Human Immune Response Primer Panel from
#' BD Bioscience for cDNA capture.

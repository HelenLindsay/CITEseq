#'@details
#'CITE-seq of T-cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)
#'for CD19, from a healthy donor and two acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
#'CAR T-cells were either unstimulated, stimulated with CD19, or stimulated
#'with a non-antigen (mesothelin).
#'
#'Three samples were pooled per sequencing lane.

#'Data were downloaded from

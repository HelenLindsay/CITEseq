#' Obtain the BBMC CITE-seq data from Triana \emph{et al.} (2021).
#'
#'@details
#'This dataset consists of four CITE-seq experiments, with scRNA-seq either
#'of the whole transcriptome or of a custom targeted mRNA capture panel of
#'462 genes relevant to haemopoetic stem cell differentiation.  Samples are
#'bone marrow cells from hip aspirates and include healthy young and old donors
#'and leukemia patients. PBMCs were also sampled from one healthy patient.
#'Samples from healthy donors were enriched for CD34+ cells.
#'\itemize{
#'  \item{97 surface proteins and targeted scRNA-seq of bone marrow samples
#'  from 3 young healthy donors and 3 old healthy donors (referred to in the
#'  manuscript as the reference dataset)}
#'  \item{97 surface proteins and whole transcriptome sequencing from a
#'  healthy young donor}
#'  \item{197 surface proteins with a custom targeted mRNA capture panel of
#'  PBMCs and BBMCs from a healthy young donor}
#'  \item{97 surface proteins and targeted mRNA from 15 leukemia patients}

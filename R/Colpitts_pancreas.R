#'@details
#'CITE-seq of cells from enzymatically digested pancreatic islets, and
#'undigested (mechanically separated) spleen cells from the same donor.
#'Pancreatic islets enriched for CD45+ cells, and a subset was further sorted by flow
#'cytometry to exclude cells expressing lineage markers, i.e. retain innate
#'lymphoid cells (ILCs).
#'
#'CITE-seq data were downloaded from
#'\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE224767}
#'
#'Flow cytometry was also performed in this study to study antibody
#'epitope susceptibility to enzymatic digestion and titrate antibody clones used
#'in CITE-seq.

#'@details
#'CITE-seq of lung tissue samples from two patients with systemic sclerosis
#'interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and one healthy control.  SScILD lung
#'tissue was obtained at lung transplantation.  Normal lung tissue was obtained
#'from organ donors.
#'
#'Samples were taken from the upper and lower lobe lung of the patients and one
#'of the controls.  For CITE-seq, cells from the upper and lower lobes were
#'mixed in equal proportions. CITE-seq samples pooled for sequencing at a ratio
#'of 85% GEX to 10% ADT to 5% HTO.  Pooled libraries were sequenced twice at
#'separate facilities; once on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and once on an
#'Illumina NextSeq 500. These libraries are combined in this data set, per cell
#'library information is not in the public data repository. Reads were aligned
#'and counted using CellRanger 3.0.2.
#'
#'scRNA-seq for 4 additional SSc-IID patients and 4 additional healthy controls
#'is available but not included in this data set.

#'@details
#'CITE-seq with TCR/BCR VDJ sequencing of longitudinal samples of PBMCs
#'from 31 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 14 age- and
#'gender-matched healthy controls.  Up to
#'four samples from different time points were taken from each COVID-19 patient,
#'starting from the time of hospital admission.
#'
#'Sequencing was performed in 3 batches.
#'
#'Data were downloaded from

#'
#'Liu \emph{et al.} also measured serum protein levels and blood cell counts.
#'These are included in the code repository (see below).
